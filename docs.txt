1- routing in express  

  A- the filtering of requests form top to bottom check on method and the path if matched then this middleware will handle the request,
    if not the last middleware will handle un matched request(404 error page).

  B- there are two calling for routes outsource (admin and shop) routes and  catch all routes (404)

  c- in outsource routes sometimes the paths have a common starting ex: 
     - '/admin/add-product'
     - '/admin/product'
       so like this we can take the duplicated part from paths in router file and put it in app.js with middleware of this route
       the if we need to trigger this route like this =>http://localhost:3000/admin/add-product 
       
  D- the same path can de used in case different methods
